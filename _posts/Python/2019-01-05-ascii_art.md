*It has been a long time since the last time I wrote a blog. This time I will be talking about a small project that can be used to generate ASCII Art from images or videos, and eventually play the generated ASCII video with music on. The source code is [here](https://github.com/Donche/ASCII_ART).*   

# 0. About ASCII art

This is surely something interesting to say. ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from the 95 printable (from a total of 128) characters defined by the ASCII Standard from 1963 and ASCII compliant character sets with proprietary extended characters[[1]](#1). It is originally used because text is more stable and faster than images. However ASCII art has now become an interesting and somewhat retro artistic expression.   

For example, an image of ASCII art of Jackie Chan on the Internet is shown below Simple characters, amazing and yet expressive.

More interestingly, ASCII art is actually very easy to generate in python. With only about 100 lines of code, I generated and displayed the ASCII art.   

# 1. Convert image to ASCII art

The main idea of this part is to map the gray value of each pixel in the image to the value corresponding to the dictionary we defined.   

We use PIL in python to process images. Firstly, use `open()` to open images. One thing important, for color images, regardless of whether the image format is PNG, BMP, or JPG, in PIL, after the `Open()` of the Image module is opened, the mode of the returned image object is "RGB". However we won't be needing the values of "RGB". So the function `convert()` is used to transform it to a gray image.   

After the transformation, we need to map a certain range of gray value to a certain character in the dictionary. So suppose we have `x` characters in the dictionary, each character will correspond to `256/x` values. So we loop through each pixel in the image and store the converted result in memory. Here's the code:   

```python
def transform_ascii(image_file): 
    image_file = image_file.convert("L") # convert image to gray
    code_pic = '' # result ASCII code
    for h in range(0,image_file.size[1]):
        for w in range(0,image_file.size[0]): 
            gray = image_file.getpixel((w,h))
            code_pic = code_pic + CODE_LIB[int(((count-1)*gray)/256)]
        code_pic = code_pic + "\n" 
    return code_pic
```

We can easily find out that an ASCII character is much more bigger than a pixel. So if we transform the image directly, the result image will be huge if we want it to be displayed in the console. So the image must be zoomed to fit the screen. So the final code of image ASCII art is as follows:   

```python
def convert_image():
    fn = input("input file name : ")
    hratio = float(input("input height zoom ratio(default 1.0) : ") or "1.0")
    wratio = float(input("input width zoom ratio(default 1.0) : ") or "1.0")
    image_file = Image.open(fn)
    image_file=image_file.resize((int(image_file.size[0]*wratio), int(image_file.size[1]*hratio)))
    print(u'Size info:',image_file.size[0],' ',image_file.size[1],' ')
    fo = open('result.txt','w')
    trans_data = transform_ascii(image_file)
    print(trans_data)
    fo.write(trans_data)
    fo.close()
```

# 2. Convert video to ASCII art

Video, in essence, is just a changing picture with sound. So, converting video to ASCII art is basically the same with what we did in the previous part. For each frame of a video, we do exactly the same process and save the result in a file.   

To deal with video, we need to import OpenCV library, which is a famous cross-platform computer vision library. It's also often used for image processing.    

The code is as below:

```python
def convert_video():
    fn = input("input file name : ")
    hratio = float(input("input height zoom ratio(default 1.0) : ") or "1.0")
    wratio = float(input("input width zoom ratio(default 1.0) : ") or "1.0")
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(fn) 
    i = 0
    if(os.path.isdir("./out") == False):
        os.makedirs("./out")
    while(cap.isOpened()): 
        ret, frame = cap.read() 
        if ret == False:
             break
        cv2.imshow('image', frame) 
        k = cv2.waitKey(5)

        os.system('cls') 
        i += 1
        tmp = open('./out/RES('+str(i)+').txt','w') 
        frame = cv2.resize(frame, (0,0), fx=wratio, fy=hratio)
        frame = Image.fromarray(cv2.cvtColor(frame,cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)) 
        trans_data = transform_ascii(frame) 
        print(trans_data) 
        tmp.write(trans_data) 
        tmp.close() 

        if (k & 0xff == ord('q')): 
            break 
    cap.release() 
    cv2.destroyAllWindows() 
```

# 3. Play ASCII art video

To generate ASCII art, it's quite simple. But to play a ASCII art video, it will need be pay more attention. Basic idea is to display the generated results one by one, with or without the music. However, the flash during two ASCII images is a big problem, and the synchronization with the sound is another. 

## 3.1 Screen painting

I used `curses` to deal with the refreshing problem. `curses` is a library who supplies a terminal-independent screen-painting and keyboard-handling facility for text-based terminals[[2]](#2). It provides lots of fancy skills to control the terminals -- adding text, erasing it, changing its appearance, etc.

So before printing the ASCII images, `curses` must be initialized by the function `stdscr = curses.initscr()`. Here are some functions I used in my code:

```python
stdscr = curses.initscr() # initialize the terminal with curses
stdscr.addstr(0,0,data) # add string to the terminal but will not be printed
stdscr.refresh() #refresh the terminal immediately
```

## 3.2 Synchronization

My original practice is to display all the results one by one and wait a certain amount of time to achieve the required playback speed. However, it took too much time to read the file and display it. Even if it didn't wait any time, it wouldn't catch up the play speed.

Therefore, some frames will definitely be ignored during playback. The number of the desired frame is calculated based on the time of the video, the number of frames and the current time. Suppose that the number of frames is N, the time of the video T, and current time t, the number of the frame required is then: `t = (int)T/N*t+1`(frame number starts from 1). 

In this case, the frame won't be displayed one by one. Instead, for each frame, the number will be calculated precisely. The code is as follows:

```python
def play_ascii_video():
    v = float(input("Frame per second: \t"))
    pmusic = input("play music?(y/n)\t")
    if(pmusic == 'y'):
        filedir = input("input music name:\t")
        thread = Thread(target = play_music, args = (filedir,))
        thread.start()
    stdscr = curses.initscr()
    stdscr.keypad(1)
    t0 = time.time()
    i = 1
    while(True):
        t1 = time.time()
        i = int((t1 - t0) * v) + 1
        filename = './out/BA('+str(i)+').txt'
        try:
            with open(filename,'r') as f:
                data = f.read()
                stdscr.addstr(0,0,data)
                stdscr.addstr("Frame: %d"%i)
                stdscr.refresh()
        except IOError:
            break
```

# 4. Conclusion

Anyway, it's really a small project that can be done in one afternoon. But it still required more skills than I expected, especially when I found out that the video playing is not what I expected at all. I tried it with a famous video [BadApple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtutLA63Cp8)(I heard it from one of my roommates who is a truly crazy ACG fan...) and the result is satisfying.

Well, of course, in theory, this code can be used for any video conversion. It suits better when the video is in the form of silhouette, but we can still use any video we like and see what it give us. It's so much fun!
